# Commit Style Guide

1. Start the commit message with the change kind (available kinds are: fix, feat, chore, ci, build, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, revert, note )
2. After the kind, write the a short summary of the changes (for example, "fix: a bugfix in component X regarding logging errors")
3. Use the imperative mood in the summary (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
4. Separate the summary from the body with a blank line.
5. Use the body to provide more detailed information about the changes.
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters per line.
7. Use bullet points for each change or feature added.
8. Use present tense in the body (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
9. Refer to any filenames/filepaths in the bullet points, for more context.
